# **Privacy Policy**  
**Effective Date:** April 21, 2025  

## **Introduction**  
Welcome to **IMS Inventory Management System**. We are committed to protecting your privacy and maintaining complete transparency regarding how your data is handled. IMS is a **fully offline desktop application** built with **Qt C++**, designed specifically for individual business owners and small enterprises to manage stock, sales, and user roles securely ‚Äî without any form of internet data transmission or third-party tracking.  

## **What Data We Collect**  
**IMS does not collect, transmit, or share any personal or business data.** All data remains strictly **stored locally** on your device within a secure **SQLite database file**. Examples of data stored include:  
- Product and stock details  
- Sales and order records  
- User accounts and encrypted credentials  
- Activity logs and notifications  
- System settings and preferences  

### üîí Local Data Handling Only  
- **No cloud or server connection**  
- **No automatic backups or data syncs**  
- **No remote database or API integration**  

## **How We Use and Secure Your Data**  
All data you input is processed **locally** by the application to enable core features such as:  
- Inventory tracking  
- Sales and order processing  
- Role-based access and user management  
- Real-time activity updates  

### üîê Security Features  
- **SHA-256 encryption** is used to hash user passwords, ensuring secure access and credential protection.  
- The application never stores or logs raw passwords or sensitive info in plain text.  

## **Permissions and Access**  
IMS may request access to the following only for offline functionality:  
- **File system access**: To store the local SQLite `.db` file, preferences, and logs  
- **RunFullTrust capability** (MSIX requirement for desktop apps): This does **not** involve any elevated or unnecessary system permissions.  

No access to internet, location, microphone, or personal files is requested or required.  

## **Third-Party Services**  
IMS is a standalone system and does **not integrate** with:  
- Advertising services  
- Analytics providers  
- Cloud-based APIs  
- Any third-party data processors  

## **Your Rights**  
Because IMS stores all information locally, **you have full control** over your data at all times. You can:  
- View, update, or delete data directly via the app  
- Remove the SQLite database manually if needed  
- Reinstall or reset the app without involving any external service  

No action is required to request data deletion or access rights from the developer.
